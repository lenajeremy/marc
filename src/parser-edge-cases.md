🧨 What’s left if you want to claim it’s “done”:
1️⃣ Nested blocks:

Blockquotes inside blockquotes.
Lists inside blockquotes.
Lists inside lists.
Code blocks inside blockquotes.
Lists with paragraphs between list items.
Inline styling inside lists or blockquotes.
2️⃣ Edge case tolerances:

Unclosed markers: **bold — what do you do?
Bad link syntax: [text](url — do you error or pass through?
Mixed markers: ***bold italic*** — does it parse right?
3️⃣ Whitespace + line breaks:

Soft line breaks vs hard breaks.
Multiple blank lines.
Indented vs fenced code blocks.
4️⃣ Actual HTML correctness:

Do you emit valid HTML every time?
Do you escape special characters inside code blocks?
Are you closing your tags correctly?
